Welcome to Stay In Tarkov!
==========================

**Stay In Tarkov (SIT)** is a Escape From Tarkov mod designed for cooperative play. SIT uses
modding frameworks such as `BepInEx <https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/>`_ and 
`SPT-AKI <https://www.sp-tarkov.com/>`_ to achieve its goal.

Stay In Tarkov is currently under development by a small team of developers. While SIT is playable, there are many bugs, 
synchronization and performance issues during gameplay. Escape From Tarkov and SPT-AKI updates frequently and oftentimes, 
your progress must be reset.

In other words, SIT is not a perfect replacement of the live experience: **always keep in mind that game breaking bugs and 
progression issues will occur and there are no way around it.**

.. _discord:

Our Discord Server is located `here <https://discord.gg/f4CN4n3nP2>`_ which you can use to talk about the mod in general or advise
us of any issues you've encountered.

.. note::
   SIT is NOT an attempt to provide an one-to-one alternative to the live experience of Escape From Tarkov. The primary 
   goal is to enable playing Escape From Tarkov with friends against enemy AI (bots).
