**Stay In Tarkov (SIT)** is a Escape From Tarkov mod designed for cooperative play with your friends. SIT uses
modding frameworks such as `BepInEx <https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/>`_ and 
`Single Player Tarkov (SPT-AKI) <https://www.sp-tarkov.com/>`_ to achieve its goal.

Stay In Tarkov is currently under development by a small team of developers. While SIT is playable, there are many bugs, 
synchronization and performance issues during gameplay. Escape From Tarkov and SPT-AKI updates frequently and oftentimes, 
your progress must be reset.

In other words, SIT is not a perfect replacement of the live experience: **keep in mind that game breaking bugs and 
progression issues will occur.**

.. note::
   SIT is NOT an attempt to provide an one-to-one alternative to the live experience of Escape From Tarkov. The primary 
   goal is to enable playing Escape From Tarkov with friends and AI (bots).
   
   Consequently, no efforts are planned to make SIT into a headless dedicated server, 
   and it is highly unlikely that such efforts will ever be made.
