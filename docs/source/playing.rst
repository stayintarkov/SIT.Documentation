.. note:: 
   So, you've made it here, **IF** you have followed the installation steps, this should be the last part you need to read before you can play.

Client
------

Once your host has followed all the set-up steps, the server should be ready for you to join, in order to join then
the host will need to give you their public IP, or if you are using a VPN, you'll need to be in their network and they need to give
you their VPN's IPv4. Once you have that follow the below steps to connect:

.. _plebpasswordwarn:

.. warning:: 
    **DO NOT USE YOUR LIVE TARKOV USERNAME AND PASSWORD. PLEASE**

    The password should not be something you use for any accounts, this is stored on the hosts machine and your machine in plain text, so please
    use a simple password you will only use for |SIT|

    **PLEASE**

    Once again, **DO NOT USE YOUR LIVE PASSWORD** or I will personally raid your Pantry

#. Open the |SITM|
#. In the Address box, put the hosts IP in like this ``http://XXX.XXX.XX.XXX:6969``
#. Give yourself a Username, can be whatever you want
#. Set-up a password **DO NOT USE ANY PASSWORD YOU NORMALLY USE.**
#. Tick Remeber me if you don't want to type all that in every time
#. Press "Connect", this should now ask you if you want to make a new account if this is your first time joining, click "Yes"
#. It will now ask what Edition of Tarkov you want, select one and press "Create"
#. If all the steps have been followed correctly by both you and the host, congrats, you should now be able to play |SIT|

.. note:: 
   Once you are in game, and have set up your character, you may be wondering how to start a raid. Well, thanks for reading this far.
   This will contain a very brief outline of starting a raid, for more info on specific parts, see the relevant Docs page for more details.

#. First pick the Raid map you want to do, when you pick one, it will ask for the time slot, the times can sometimes desync between clients so make sure you pick the same slot number, eg. Slot 1 or 2
#. If you wanted to play Solo you can click "Play Singleplayer" (Obvs). Otherwise, the player that presses "Host Raid" should be the one with the best PC and Network
#. Pick how many players you want, make sure this matches how many people will join, this **INCLUDES** you, the game will not start until everyone has joined
#. Don't worry about password unless you are playing on a larger server hosted publically
#. Pick how many bots, and how difficult you want them, and decide if you want the chance for Bosses to spawn
#. For protocal select either Relay or Peer-To-Peer, if you would like to see the differences see :ref:`FAQ <p2pr>`
#. Hit start, your clients should now be able to see it in the server browser, if they picked the same map and time slot
#. Once everyone has joined, the Raid should now start, have fun, and remeber, nothing is more Friendly than Friendly Fire
