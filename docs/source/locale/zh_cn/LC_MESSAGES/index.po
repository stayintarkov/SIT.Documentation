"**Stay In Tarkov (SIT)** is a Escape From Tarkov mod designed for "
"cooperative play. SIT uses modding frameworks such as `BepInEx "
"<https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/>`_ and `SPT-AKI <https://www.sp-"
"tarkov.com/>`_ to achieve its goal."

"Stay In Tarkov is currently under development by a small team of "
"developers. While SIT is playable, there are many bugs, synchronization "
"and performance issues during gameplay. Escape From Tarkov and SPT-AKI "
"updates frequently and oftentimes, your progress must be reset."

"In other words, SIT is not a perfect replacement of the live experience: "
"**always keep in mind that game breaking bugs and progression issues will"
" occur and there are no way around it.**"

"SIT is NOT an attempt to provide an one-to-one alternative to the live "
"experience of Escape From Tarkov. The primary goal is to enable playing "
"Escape From Tarkov with friends against enemy AI (bots)."

"Consequently, no efforts are planned to make SIT into a headless "
